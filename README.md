#### A learning project focused on leveling-up with:
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) DOM traversal and manipulation.
* The [model/view/controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) software architecture pattern.
* Principles of [clean](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [self-documenting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code).
* Mobile-first responsive design.
* [HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

## Description

This was my first attempt at creating a "professional" web development portfolio, but it came a little too soon in my career. I'm very proud of some of the cool, expressive stuff that is going on here, but I;ve been told more than once that it is "a little much". A lot of love went into this website, and it will always be one of my favorites.
