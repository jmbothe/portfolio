  <section class="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm Jeff, front-end web developer, photographer, and traveler from Baltimore, MD.</p>
    <p>I am currently living in Manizales, Colombia, where I devote all of my free time to leveling-up my tech skills...</p>
    <p>Well, almost all of my free time. I also make a regular habit of climbing the local volcanoes when the weather is good.</p>
    <p>Scroll down, have a look around, and be sure to get in touch :)</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here you'll find a selection of projects I'm particularly proud of. All aliteration aside, I think you'll like them too.
      Click each project's Github link to read an in-depth discussion of the development process, or click the demo link to see it live.

        <h3>Drum Machine</h3>
        <div class="portfolio-links">
          <a href="https://jmbothe.github.io/drum-sequencer/dist/" target="_blank">Demo</a>
          <a href="https://github.com/jmbothe/drum-sequencer" target="_blank">Github</a>
        </div>
        <p>This is a very basic drum sequencer that has three options for drum kit sounds, two toggle-able measures of 16th notes, and a tempo slider that ranges between 30bpm and 150bpm. It was originally conceived as a learning exercise in jQuery, but quickly grew to double as a serious challenge in wrangling the Web Audio API.</p>

      <div class="client-website">
        <h3>Client Website</h3>
        <div class="portfolio-links">
          <a href="https://jmbothe.github.io/photo-phinish/" target="_blank">Demo</a>
          <a href="https://github.com/jmbothe/photo-phinish" target="_blank">Github</a>
        </div>
        <p>This is a basic website for a local painting business, which uncoincidentally is run by my brother. This is the first website I ever built that wasn't a clone of a popular homepage like Apple or Mint. This is also the first time I ever used a front-end framework to build a website. I chose to work with Foundation for Sites.</p>

      <div class="calculator">
        <h3>Calculator</h3>
        <div class="portfolio-links">
          <a href="https://jmbothe.github.io/calculator-MVC/dist/" target="_blank">Demo</a>
          <a href="https://github.com/jmbothe/calculator-MVC" target="_blank">Github</a>
        </div>
        <p>This calculator was built for personal edification, and is based on two major influences. On the surface, it is an attempt to reverse engineer the basic functionality of the iOS10 calculator (in portrait view). Under the hood, it is an attempt to follow the rudiments of the MVC design pattern.</p>

        <h3>Todo List</h3>
        <div class="portfolio-links">
          <a href="https://jmbothe.github.io/todo-list/dist/" target="_blank">Demo</a>
          <a href="https://github.com/jmbothe/todo-list" target="_blank">Github</a>
        </div>
        <p>Every newbie coder must at some point commit themselves to completing a todo list app tutorial. I was lucky enough to stumble across the <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">Watch and Code - Practical Javascript tutorial.</a> This was an absolute game changer for me--a revelation on so many levels--and I highly recommend it to all newbs.</p>
